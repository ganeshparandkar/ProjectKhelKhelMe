                                                    child, my addiction is only recent. In this article, I am going

                        margin: 0;">Just a few months back, I bought some
                                                    Jigsaw
                                                    puzzles of 250, 500 and 1000 pieces for our annual game
                                                    programmes.
                                                    To get a sense of timing, I decided to first solve one before I
                                                    give
                                                    it to the kids. The very first one of 250 pieces got me hooked
                                                    on to
                                                    it, and the Jigsaw fever started growing on me. Before I could
                                                    know,
                                                    I was already an addict. Another design of 250 pieces, then
                                                    another
                                                    and another… </p>

                                                <p style=" color: #adb7bd;
                        font-family: 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
                        font-size: 16px;
                        line-height: 26px;
                        text-indent: 30px;
                        margin: 0;">Solving the first one of 250 pieces was
                                                    quite
                                                    challenging; so before moving on to 500, I solved a few more of
                                                    250
                                                    and even repeated them. Then one Saturday, after the Jigsaw
                                                    class
                                                    with the kids, I dared to begin with the 500 pieces set. It was
                                                    crazy! One of my friend joined me too, and we both were hooked
                                                    on to
                                                    it till 2.00 am, yet it wasn’t complete till the following day.
                                                </p>

                        line-height: 26px;
                        text-indent: 30px;
                        margin: 0;">Next weekend, I again picked up the same
                                                    500
                                                    pieces set, and timed myself. It took me almost 7 hours to solve
                                                    it
                                                    all by myself. Every weekend, I would look forward to solving
                                                    one
                                                    set. The next 500 pieces set that I picked up was a tough one
                                                    and it
                                                    rolled over to a few days to solve it (putting in some time
                                                    daily)
                                                    along with an 8-day tour in between. </p>

                                                    initiated me
                                                    to start with my 1000 pieces set. This was a tough one dominated
                                                    by
                                                    just 2-3 colours. Searching for just the border pieces and
                                                    completing it took me over an hour. It took me 6 days to
                                                    complete

                                                    Bloom's Taxonomy is a hierarchical model
                                                    used
                                                    to classify the Educational Learning Objectives. It is
                                                    an important theory considered while planning the curriculum. It
                                                    covers three domains – Cognitive,
                                                    Affective and Psychomotor Domains. Each of these domains have

                                                    The Cognitive domain has six hierarchical
                                                    levels. Let us understand each level, and what kind of games can
                                                    be
                                                    useful to stimulate them. The first level
                                                    is to ‘Remember’, which is given the highest importance in our
                                                    current education system. Most of the
                                                    examinations require this level to be achieved. Thus, for

                                                    success, the first step it to have a

                                                    Most of us have a good long-term memory,
                                                    but
                                                    working memory is different than long term memory.
                                                    There is a big range of games that can enhance our working

                                                    depending on the environment and exposure they have received. To

                                                    story. The game play is about associating one of your cards to a
                                                    given theme or story, and
                                                    then voting for the cards on display. The more people that can
                                                    associate a card to the given
                                                    theme, the higher the chance of winning for the card owner.

                                                    A card game by the Think Fun company which requires one to think
                                                    creatively and associate
                                                    the picture cards to a situation or a story. From a variety of
                                                    colourful picture cards, we need
                                                    to think of a name that begins with the last letter of the previous
                                                    card. This truly exercises

                                                    Amongst the children that I meet and interact with, mostly I see
                                                    their ability to reflect and review is
                                                    very low. So, at Khel Khel Mein, one of our most important ritual is
                                                    the Review Circle - to reflect on
                                                    all that we learnt or experienced. Initially very few kids are able
                                                    to reflect and give their feedback,
                                                    but over the time, sooner or later, most develop this ability. They
                                                    are allowed to say whatever they
                                                    feel, and are not judged whatsoever.

                                                    followed by the facilitator. But
                                                    one can play games that involve debating or negotiation to improve

                                                    to Create. This refers to one's ability to
                                                    design or formulate something original on one's own. This requires

                                                    levels. In order to create something, one has to get a deep

                                                    are children at this level in their specific fields of interest. For

                                                Yes, just look into
                                                each other’s eyes for at least 3 to 5 minutes. Move so close to each
                                                other that the knees
                                                are nearly touching. If required, play your favourite song in the
                                                background and keep
                                                looking at each other till the song is over. This is not a blinking
                                                game, where you are not
                                                allowed to blink. You may surely blink, but continue looking into
                                                each
                                                other’s eyes. Just as
                                                simple as it sounds, it is an intense exercise. It has a huge impact
                                                on
                                                the connectedness,
                                                and you will clearly see the magic work on you once you start this.
                                                If
                                                your partner is not
                                                the kind who will like to play this game, just fix your eyes on your
                                                partner’s. Don’t say
                                                anything, just keep looking. Let the magic work for you both!</p>

                                                A quick game that you can play whenever you are together. Come up
                                                with a
                                                theme each time you
                                                play this game, and list 5 things within the theme. For example,
                                                “Things
                                                I like about you”,
                                                “Things I am scared of”, “Things I am grateful for” “Things I wanna

                                                with you this week”.
                                                You could alternate saying it one by one, or say all five in one-go.
                                                Good idea would be to
                                                make a small jar and make various small chits listing different
                                                themes.
                                                Each time you want
                                                to play, just pick one chit from the jar. Be creative, you could get
                                                silly at times, be
                                                honest! Once you are done, appreciate each other, hug each other,
                                                and

                                                questions if required, come up with new themes together. Hope you

                                                    critical thinking. Play allows one to explore ‘cause and
                                                    effect’.
                                                    Provide indoor and
                                                    outdoor space for playing, along with pretend play. This would

                                                    them time to think,
                                                    plan, attempt and complete or let them even fail at it. Just

                                                    without further
                                                    instructions or corrections. It’s not easy, silently count 60 in

                                                    curious. Rather than directly answering to a query, ask back,

                                                    do you think about
                                                    it?” Give opportunities to think of possibilities. Do NOT judge
                                                    his/her responses.
                                                    Respect what the child says! You may further probe and ask for

                                                    details. This will
                                                    develop the ability and confidence in the child to think and

                                                    As a parent, you may always have situations
                                                    where you want to step
                                                    in. But holding back, and allowing the child to complete a task

                                                    also use PLAY to enhance thinking skills. There are various

                                                    and toys that develop
                                                    thinking skills in kids or adults. Play allows exploring ‘cause

                                                    One commonly known play for thinking skills is
                                                    Puzzles. There are
                                                    various types of puzzles available – jigsaw puzzle, lateral thinking
                                                    metal puzzles, visual
                                                    puzzles etc. Puzzles of all types allow one to explore by trying
                                                    multiple moves and ways in
                                                    order to reach the solution. Provide different types of puzzles, not

                                                    puzzles. Each type will develop a different type of thinking

                                                    made
                                                    of various material
                                                    including wood, metal, plastic, paper, cloth etc. One important
                                                    factor is that toys must
                                                    be made from hazard-free material and must follow the safety
                                                    standards. When buying toys
                                                    for very young children, remember that the child is likely to
                                                    put
                                                    the toy in mouth. So,
                                                    avoid buying toys with very small parts or those not checked for
                                                    safety standards. Also
                                                    look for sharp edges in any toys as they could cause injuries.
